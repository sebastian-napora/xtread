Choose your authentication method — **API Key** or **[Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/?tab=coding-plan#/efm/coding-plan-index)** ([intl](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/?tab=coding-plan#/efm/coding-plan-index)) — and follow the prompts to configure. See the API setup guide ([Beijing](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/cn-beijing/?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=3023091) / [intl](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/ap-southeast-1?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&url=2974721)) for step-by-step instructions. Then let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
what does this project do?
```

## What Xtread Code does for you

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Xtread Code what you want to build in plain language. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Xtread Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Xtread Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](./features/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
- **[Followup suggestions](./features/followup-suggestions)**: Xtread Code predicts what you want to type next and shows it as ghost text. Press Tab to accept, or just keep typing to dismiss.

## Why developers love Xtread Code

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Xtread Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Xtread Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](./features/mcp) lets Xtread Code read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use _your_ custom developer tooling.
- **Unix philosophy**: Xtread Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | qwen -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` _works_. Your CI can run `qwen -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
